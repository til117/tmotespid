Communication for Tmote sensors in a WSN with a computer, a TestBed for temperature control in a room using PID controller.

As part of my bachelor thesis (PID Controllers in Smart Buildings), I implement a TestBed for temperature control in a room using a PID controller.

The hardware used are Tmote sensors. I am using 3 of them: 2 are used as temperature sensors, and 1 is used as an actuator (connected to the computer). The data is transfered to the computer and plotted in real time.
